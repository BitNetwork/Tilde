# Tilde

## Running the bot
You can add my instance of Tilde to your server via auth.html or [here](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?permissions=1610087503&scope=bot&client_id=268230663025590274). This might be seldomly running and not secured (i.e. no permissions).

You can run your instance via cloning the repository

```git clone https://github.com/BitNetwork/Tilde.git```
installing the dependencies (`ytdl-core` for the music mod),
```npm install discord.js node-opus ytdl-core```
configuring config.json to operate on your bot's token and executing the tilde.js.
```node index.js```
